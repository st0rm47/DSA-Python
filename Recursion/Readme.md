# Recursion

## What is Recursion?
Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

## How does Recursion work?
Recursion works by breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable problems. It then solves each of these smaller problems and combines the results.
